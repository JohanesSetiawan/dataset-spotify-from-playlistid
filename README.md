## Creating a dataset Playlist from Spotify

Spotify is a platform that provides digital music streaming service. It gives access to millions of songs, podcasts and videos from artists all over the world.

## Usage

1. Go to Spotify Developer Dashboard and create an app. You will get a Client ID and Client Secret.
2. Run `main.py` and enter the Client ID, Client Secret and Playlist ID.
3. The program will create a CSV file with the name `datasetSpotify.csv` in the same directory as `main.py`.

##

You can change the number of songs in the playlist by changing the value of `limit`, `fields`, `market`, value in `jsonResult`, and value in dataset on `main.py`.
